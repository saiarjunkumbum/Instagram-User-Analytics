# Instagram-User-Analytics

User Analysis is a process by which we track how users engage 
and interact with our digital product (software or mobile 
applications) in an attempt to derive business insights for 
marketing, product & development teams.
These insights are then used by teams across the business to 
launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build 
for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user 
management and Improve the experience altogether while 
helping the business grow.
